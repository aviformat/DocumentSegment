Sample Preparation
To properly prepare materials for mtcroetruc-tural analysis, all surface and subsurface damage must be removed. For ceramics, surface damage is characterized by either grain pullout or scratches. Subsurfaoe damage is harder to identify, but usually takes the term of subsurface cracks or grain fracture
Indentation studies by Lawn et at.1 * reveal that abrasive interaction with the surface is dependent upon both the abraeive shape (sharp or bhmt indentation) and its bonding character* tattcs (rigid or looae}, For ceramics, a sharp abraatve (tndenter) tenda to produce ftcse seme*
