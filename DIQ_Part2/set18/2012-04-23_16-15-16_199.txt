This paper defines transuranic (TRU) waste, summarizes TRU waste volumes, discusses the characteristics of stored TRU waste at each of the DOE storage sites that will be shipping waste to the WIPP, and identifies predicted generation rates for TRU waste at each of the generator sites. Also included are summaries of site plans with regard to certification of the waste so that all waste shipments meet the WIPP Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC). Schedules for the facilities that will be utilized to process and certify the waste, and brief discussions of facility capabilities are also included in this article.
| WASTE INVENTORIES Contact-Handled Waste
The contact-handled (CH) TRU waste stored and generated at Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored facilities results from defense-related research and development activities, as well as nuclear weapons production. The waste consists of materials such as [ rubber gloves, clothing, laboratory glassware, discarded tools and equipment, and process residues that are contaminated with TRU radionuclides (atomic number greater than 92) in concentrations greater than 100 nCi/g. As defined in DOE Order
5820.2A, TRU waste includes i *
