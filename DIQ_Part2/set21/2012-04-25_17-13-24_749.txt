1	Introduction
image Understanding research at the MIT AI Lafe has continued along a range ai fronts, from km level processing. such as stereo. motion. color and texture analysis, through intermediate stages of integration of vonai rnf? r-mation. to higher level tasks such as object recognition and navigation. This report summarises our main recent accomplishments in these areas As b usual in tbese reports, we refer interested readers to other publication* for more details.
2	Object Recognition
Because it has been one of our central focal points, we begin with our recent work in object recognition. In ap-proacmng the problem of recognizing objects from noisy images of cluttered scenes we have found it convenient to separate out several different aspects of the problem.
•	Selection: Given a large set of image features from a cluttered scene, select (or group) subsets likely to have come from single objects and use a rank ordering to place the most salient ones first
•	Indexing: Given one of these image feature subsets. select a small set of object models from the library that are likely to match the data
•	Matching: Given a data feature subset and an object model, determine if there is a legal transformation that would carry the model into a pose in the image that is consistent with the data, possibly by finding a matching between data and model features. It is often useful to separate this stage into two subproblems:
- Hypothesise possible solutions, using minimal model and image information.

2.1 Sgferticn sad Atteatioci
We ha«e argued lor suaar umt that robust and ettnmt solutions lo the *eiect«on (or gmupMig, problem are essential to practical recognition systems Earlier work, using kotk formal analysis and 1 rjumw milill: I}, 271, has ilnvs ftiiat ikr cosnplpxitv of many approaches to fftognioi are dranaiirafly reduced if defeat selection in provided, and that the fabe posi-liw/fahr negative rales lor sweh nrtko4 are abo significantly unproved with good selection
Oar advantage of for aw tig na the nswe nf selection for recognition s that it provides const nun on th* r^tair^ ments of early processing stages For ninylr run -oich as roior or texture are often considered from the viewpoint of extracting object sni fnc 1 measurements which requires that one account for ittummatioa and «uher •scene eftrcts in inverting the image measurements to obtain object parameters Ifose simply wants to use lb*-*** cues to separate regions of aa image likely to have rmir from a single object, much less stringent re*tuir<niieti 1 > are placed on the task, leading to simpler and ho|»efutlv more robust algorithms
Towards this end, Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood has re. cently completed a Ph D these [46] that explore the role of cues such as color and texture in select** for recognition She does this by developing and implementing a computational model of visual attention. w!n«-h serves as a general purpose selection mechanism in a recognition system.
The approach supports two modes of attentional behavior, namely otirmrted Attention and psy-«ffraf«*t» modes. The attracted attention mode of behavior spontaneous and is commonly exhibited by an unbiased observer (i.e., with no a priori intentions) when s* object or some aspect of the scene attracts his/her attention, while the latter is a more deliberate behavior exhibited by an observer looking at a scene with a goals (such as the task of recognizing an object, say) an«l hence paying attention to only those objects/aspects I a scene that are relevant to the goal.
BrieHy, the model suggests that the scene represent! by the image be processed by a set of interacting featur*-
