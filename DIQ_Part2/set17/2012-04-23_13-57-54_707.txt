Furxhermorc, be* cause the statistical characteristics of the interference change with time, the adaptive weight determination must be performed repetitively and in real time.
When the antenna array is on board a satellite, the number of antenna dements that can be nulled in practice is limited by the combination of the real-time requirement driven by satellite motion and the cubic de-

Because of its no*d architecture, it can be compactly realised by using restructur-able wafer-scale integration; the resulting system fits in a 4-in square. MUSE ts substantially smaller and lighter than a conventional processor, and it uses substantially less power. Although die MUSE processor is special-tied for N * 64 antennas, the MUSE design concept can be applied to the design of a similar processor for an antenna array with a different number of elements.
We briefly explain the mathematics of adaptive nuH-
