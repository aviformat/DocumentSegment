Recently, several organizations in our surrounding rn—imity have asked us to help thee recruit some edult citizens to help contribute to the lives of youth at risk of academic failure through mentoring.
We have asked representatives from these organizations to talk about their programs and how the Seettle University community can get involved* lie also thought it mould be a good time to talk about our own mentorship program that supports incoming freshmen in their transition to college life et S.0.
On Tuesday May 17th from 12:00-1:00 in the Chieftain the Volunteer Center has scheduled a forum about mentors. Panelists from the community will address youth at risk and how we can help. Panelists Include Margaret Berrie from Garfield High, Kari Mount from Middle College High, and Gregory Devis from Central Area Motivation Program (CAMP)• Carle Srickson from Pathways will discuss how the S.U. community can help support our incoming freshmen, through discussion groups, and other various activities.
