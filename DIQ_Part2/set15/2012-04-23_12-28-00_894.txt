Subject: Forum on mentorship, sponsored by the Volunteer Center and Minority Affairs
Recently, several organizations in our surrounding community have asked us to help them recruit some adult citizens to help contribute to the lives of youth at risk of academic failure through mentoring.
Me have asked representatives from these organizations to talk about their programs and how the Seattle University community can get involved. Me also thought it would be a good time to talk about our own mentorship program that supports incoming freshmen in their transition to college life at S.U.
On Tuesday May 17th from 12:00-1:00 in the chieftain the Volunteer Center has scheduled a forum about mentors. Panelists from the community will address youth at risk and how we can help. Panelists include Margaret Barrie from Garfield High, Kari Mount from Middle College High, and Gregory Davis from Central Area Motivation Program (CAMP). Carla Erickaon from Pathways will diacuse how the S.U. community can help support our incoming freshmen, through discussion groups, and other various activities.
Please help us spread the word and join us at this forum. For more information call the Volunteer Center at X6035.
