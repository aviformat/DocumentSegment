Re: California Campaign Contributions to The Tobacco Institute
Dear Art:
The Tobacco Institute has been making contributions to California candidate and ballot measure committees during 1991. Since these contributions are being made from Institute general treasury funds, California law requires that the contributions be pro rated among the members of the Institute based upon dues assessments received by the Institute during the period of the campaign contributions.
Below is a chronological listing of your company's pro rata share of The Tobacco Institute California contributions:
As you know, this firm monitors your company's campaign activity in California and discloses those contributions on a California Major Donor Campaign Statement if certain thresholds are met. The above captioned amounts will be disclosed both on The Tobacco Institute's campaign statement and also on your company's Major Donor Campaign Statement. If you have any questions regarding this allocation, please do not hesitate to contact Kirk Alan Pessner, our Senior Paralegal/Administrator of our Political Reports Unit or me.
