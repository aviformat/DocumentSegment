3.1 Image Generation
This pert of the protocol dttoibo haw, fa ictordutt with the specified model, * suitably random, independent, and representative nt of images from the pop> uiation of ideals is to be acquired or generated to constitute the templed set of images This aqutsittoo can be done by taking real images under the specified conditions or by generating synthetic images- If the population includes, for example, a range of sizes of the object of interest or if the object of interest can appear in a variety of situations, or if the object shape can have a range of variations, then the sampling mechanism must assure that a reasonable number of images are sampled with the object appearing in sites, orientations, and shape variations throughout its permissible range Similarly, if the object to be recognised or measured can appear in a variety of different lighting conditions which create a similar variety in shadowing, then the sampling must assure that images are acquired with the lighting and shadowing varying throughout its permissible range.
Some of the variables used in the image generation process are ones whose values will be estimated by the computer vision algorithm. We denote these variables by Zi,...,Zk Other of these variables are nuisance variables. Their values provide for variation. The performance characterization is averaged over their values.
