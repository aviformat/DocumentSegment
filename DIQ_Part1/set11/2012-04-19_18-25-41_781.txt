TraditkmiDy, the Uiiti of ft robots perctplKm sftdm ftre to dtitcl obstacles, find tbe free ftpta, and eHimitc tin pontioo of the robot m iht world But, the locus on building * utefu! 3-D detcriptiofi of the world. Our 3-D representation ol tbe environment differs primarily from representations used by other robots in thftt:
1,	It mutt concentrftte on Hnunntiadly significant features.
2,	It must be more accurate thftn it ttrictiy necessary for navigation alone.
To sfttisfy the first constraint, we chote to concent r tie on straight edges with particular orientations in the 3-D scene, Typically, there are three prominent 3*D orientations in indoor scenes and outdoor urban scenes: the vertical, and two horizontal orientfttions perpendicular to each other. Our approach considers only polyhedral objects with such edges. This assumption holds for most large architectural features such as walls, door* ways, floors, and ceilings. The second constraint, accuracy, has multiple implications for both the hardware and the software of the robot.
