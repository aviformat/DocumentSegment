Dear Charlie,
Since returning to London, my colleague Jackie Pontin and I have given more thought to how best to capitalize upon the studies on high and low familial risk of lung cancer which are just being set up with Henry Lynch. Since Dr. Lynch will be taking the trouble of mounting the field studies in various types of "high" and "low" risk cancer pedigrees, I feel strongly that we should not miss the opportunity of establishing immortal cell lines on each of the 400 subjects which we will study. Such is my conviction that I believe these studies should be started immediately and not constrained by my move to Newcastle.  Here is my proposal:
Omaha will be recruiting 400 subjects, each phenotyped with debrisoquine in vivo : they will fall into four groups of equal size; sporadic lung cancers with no other cancer family history ("low" risk), sporadic lung cancers with positive cancer family history, colon cancer-prone families with high and low family histories. These latter two types of pedigree are very interesting from the following point of view, that of the 2000 members of the 10 kindreds, there is only one known case of lung cancer. Immortalized EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cell lines will provide a future resource for studying the molecular genetics of lung cancer risk. We are already looking in cohorts with cDNA probes and RPLP analysis for various P450 polymorphisms which we believe may bear upon lung cancer risk. At relatively small additional cost (supplemented by CTR?) Dr. Lynch could mail us small batches of fresh blood for B-cell transformation. I cannot see how this should add more than about $5 to the cost of each sample collection, or $2000 in toto, but he needs to be asked. At our end we shall need Ms. Pontin's salary with on-costs. ($45,000 for 18 months) together with consumable costs for cell transformation, culture and cryopreservation of $75 per cell line (cf. $500 NIH contracted - out cost!), i.e. $30,000. In addition, we would need to purchase a liquid nitrogen Dewar for storing the cell lines ($1600). The total cost of the project for the first year would thus be $51,600 (2/3 $45,000 + 2/3 $30,000 + $1,600).

It is improbable that this type of collaborative opportunity will present itself again; Henry Lynch has a unique resource which I should like to help make "more permanent". Please do not hesitate to call me at home or the laboratory for any further clarification of these proposals. It may help you to know that gifts and donations made to named individuals for purposes of research are zero-rated for overheads in this institution. Grants however, approved by our Finance Office, have an indirect cost of 40% added.
With kindest regards, Yours sincerely,
