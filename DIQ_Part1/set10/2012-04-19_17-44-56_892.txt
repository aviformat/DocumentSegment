Dear Ckirlk,
Since returning to London. my collaagee Jack la P—tie asni I kavt |hta ao»« thought to how best to capitalist apoa the studiea aa t«4 law familial rasfc af lung caacer which irt Jatt Nit| sst up with Hsary Lytdk Sftaea Dr. lysdi wilt be taking the trouble of asoaatiag the field Hsdtts la vsflsvs types at	aad "low*

Hare it »y ptopoeal:
Omaha will be recruiting 400 sabjsets, eaek pheaetyped will debeiaoaeiae tm itie : they will fait into four groups of equal sire; sporadic laag caacers with m other caacer family history flow* risk),, sporadic laag caacers with positive casteer family history, colon csnoer-proae famlllea with kigk sad taw family histories. These latter two types of pedigree are very iatcrestiag from the followiag poiat of view, thst of the 2000 members of the 10 kindreds, there Is oaly oji£ kaowa case of laag caacer. Immortslised EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid ft-eell liaee will provide a future resource for studying the molecular genetics of laag caacer risk. We are already looking In cohorts with cDNA probes aad RPLf analysis for various P450 polymorphisms which we believe may bear upon laag cancer risk. At rclstlvely small additioaal cost (supplemented by CTH?) Dr. Lynch could mail as small batches of fresh blood for B-ccll transformation 1 cannot ses how this should sdd more than about $5 to the cost of each sample collection, or $2006 Im i&to, bat he needs to be asked. At our end we shsll need Ms. Pontln*s salary with oa-costs. ($45,000 for 18 months) together with consumeble costs for cell transformation, culture aad cryopreservstloa of $75 per cell line (f/. $500 NIH contracted • out oostlX J«*. $30,000. In addition, we would need to purchsss a liquid nitrogsn Dewar for storing the cell lines ($1600). The tots I cost of the project for the first yesr would thus be $51,600 (2/3 $45,000 + 2/3 $30,000 ♦ $1,600).
