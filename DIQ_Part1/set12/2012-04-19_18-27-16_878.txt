1	Abstract
We track, in real-time, the position and posture of a human body, using a minimal number of 6 DOF sensors to capture full body standing postures. We use 4 sensors to create a good approximation of a human operator's position and posture, and map it on to our articulated computer graphics human model. The unsensed joints are positioned by a fast inverse kinematics algorithm. Our goal is to realistically recreate human postures while minimally encumbering the operator.
2	Background
Ideally, a virtual environment interface should be able to measure and recreate a participant's posture exactly. Rather than the traditional "disembodied hand" approach, we would like to generate a complete, realistically postured human image. However, the equipment needed to accurately track every body segment (or joint angle) of a human is costly and cumbersome. We face several questions: how closely must the virtual human's posture match the operator's, and how much information do we need to achieve this degree of realism?
As in other areas of VR, the degree of realism necessary depends greatly on the tasks we would like to perform [11]. We have concentrated on creating an interface that will allow a human participant to
perform basic tasks, using a minimal number of sen- Figure 1: Sensor Placement and Support Polygon sors to derive feasible, reasonably accurate postures. Three pieces of information are essential for our posture reconstruction algorithm: the participant's view vector, center of mass, and the location of the end-effectors the participant will use to interact with the
