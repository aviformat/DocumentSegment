Dear. Georges
This letter is to confirm your conversation .with T. A. Vollmuth on October 1, 1986 in which we gave verbal authorization to cancel scheduled testing on- material B207 which was submitted on September 23, 1986 for the 14-Day Subacute Toxicity Study in Rats and the Multi-dose Rangefinder in Rats.
Test material A177, Hazleton project number 642-365, which was lethal in the 14-Day study when 80% propylene glycol was used' as the vehicle, will be retested in place of B207 for the 14-day study only.
Also, we are submitting an- additional sample of B198 in order to complete the multi-dose phase of the rangefinder study.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
