Dear Doctor Gardner!
I am matt pleated that yoo have asked mo to servo as an ad hoc consultant to the Scientific Advisory loard of the Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A., Inc. I am also prepared to give an Informal talk to the Scientific Advisory Board on March 14. 1 should like to present the results and interpretations of work that has recently bean done, and It being done, in my laboratory, rather than to talk on the subjects you have mentioned In your letter. My Idwatuy has been occupied with a tumor model as It progresses and regresses In two inbred strains of rati ond we are looking at the immunologic phenomena that are associated with these states. 1 hope that this subject will be acceptable to you since it It one that I am least (am liar with and can speak with soma authority of experience.
t look forward to teeing yew then on the 14th of March in Phoenix, Arizona. I would be tatarartad to leam what day, or day*, wilt be needed for the poor review of applications that fceva boon tubmitted.
Sworely yawn,
