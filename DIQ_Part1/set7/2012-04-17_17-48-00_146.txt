William U. Gardiner, Ph.D. Scientific Director The Council for Tobacco
   Research - U.S.A,, Inc. 110 East 59th Street New York, New York 10022
Dear Doctor Gardner:
I am most pleased that you have asked me to serve at on ad hoc consultant to the Scientific Advisory Board of the Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A., Inc. I am also prepared to give an informal talk to the Scientific Advisory Board on March 14. I should like to present the results and interpretation* of work that has recently been done, and is being done, in my laboratory, rather than to talk on the subjects you have mentioned in your letter. My laboratory has been occupied with a tumor model as it progresses and regresses in two inbred strains of rats and we are looking at the immunologic phenomena that are associated with these states. I hope that this subject will be acceptable to you since it it one that 1 am most familar with and can speak with some authority of experience.
I look forward to seeing you then on the 14th of March in Phoenix, Arizona. I would be Interested to learn what day, or days, will be needed for the peer review of applications that have been tubmitted.
Sincerely yourt,
