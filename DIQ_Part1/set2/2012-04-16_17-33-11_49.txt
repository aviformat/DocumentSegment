Honorable John Faso Legislative Office Building Room 448 Albany, NY 12248
Dear Mr. Faso:
A bill currently making its way through the New York Assembly poses * severe threat to the promotional markehng and advertising industries
This measure, Assembly Bill 7139. seeks to prevent tobacco w by mmor i by, | other things, banning all cigar cue advertising with the exception of ads that appear in newspapers or magazines
This proposal is itt-coocerved and potentially destructive to ray industry. wiach employs thousands of people in New York State- Studies both abroad and w the Itaaed States have determined that cigarette advertising plays a mmmal role is an iarifciduaTs decision to smoke. Peer influence, and the influence of parents and older siblings, a by &r the dominant factor. Banning advertising, therefore, will not aifeet tha incidence of smoking by youths.
Besides being ill-suited to achieve its stated purpose, this proposal is uncomtmmonal. Since the 197V*, the courts have ruled that commercial speech is protected under the First Amendment. Unfortunately, by the time the courts get around to overturning this measure, the economic damage will already have been done.to my industry and many others.
I hope you will take the above into consideration and oppose the passage of Assembly BUI 7139.
