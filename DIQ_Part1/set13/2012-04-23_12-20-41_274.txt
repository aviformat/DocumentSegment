Figure 3: Processing image sequences
to be wasted on segments that cannot be reconstructed accurately because their 3-D orientation is parallel to the direction of motion. Generally, the line detector ignores many undesirable segments that result from non-architectural elements of the scene, which should not appear in a CAD model (such as people walking by). This, too, makes wrong matches less likely.
