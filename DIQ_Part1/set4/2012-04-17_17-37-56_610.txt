Dear Bud:
As you can see from the attached, we are rolling out the Virginia Slims 120*s test into the Oklahoma City (5M0), Tulsa (5N0) and Kansas City (6B0) trading areas.
The official start date is July 1. However, because of the July 4th holiday, posting can begin on June 27 in these markets.
Please let me know if you have any problems or questions.
Very truly yours,

Kay L. Galeotti
